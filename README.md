# FizzBuzz
Deliberate practice with different programming approaches using FizzBuzz.

### Why Am I Doing This?
The keyword here is *deliberate*. I'm trying to solve the same problem - FizzBuzz - in as many different ways as possible. 
This concentrated effort on one problem will allow me to find new ways of looking at the problem. 
I'm using something I know well so I'm not distracted by learning new things or looking up new information. 
Instead, I'm consciously trying to change my perspective each time I solve the problem.

### Key Benefits
I expect that most of the solutions I create will not be applicable to actual software. 
Instead I'm developing my ability to approach problems in different ways and finding 
unique solutions to the problem that I might not otherwise develop.

The other benefit I expect is that it will force me to try techniques I rarely use like bit shifting. 
I expect to gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript in the process through that purposeful 
exploration of the language.

Finally, if you ever find yourself interviewing me for a job - FizzBuzz is one problem I'm guessing we'll be able to skip. 
Or at least we'll be able to have a more interesting discussion about it!


### Index
I've grouped some of the solutions I created for easy refenrence in sections:
